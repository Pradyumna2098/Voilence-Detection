# Objective
- Identify critical factors and correlations contributing to violence.​
- Enhance understanding of violence dynamics.​
- Develop informed strategies for violence prevention and intervention.

# Dataset
- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohamedmustafa/real-life-violence-situations-dataset

# Techniques Used for Analysis
- **Dataset Preparation:** Collect or use publicly available video datasets containing violent and non-violent scenes.​
- **Feature Extraction:** Extract relevant features from video frames (e.g., optical flow-based features, motion descriptors).​
- **Transfer Learning:** Fine-tune MobileNetV2 on your violence dataset by retraining the top layers.​
- **Classification:** Use the modified MobileNetV2 to classify video frames as violent or non-violent.​
- **Evaluation:** Evaluate the model’s performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
